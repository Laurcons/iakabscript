# IakabScript Standard Interpreter (ISSI)
This is the official interpreter implementation for IakabScript.

It is currently under development, as I have to figure out how to properly use the underlying tools and to make a proper language interpreter in C.

## What it does now
* It can parse top-level variable declarations and assignments.
* Prints in the console, very verbosely, what it's doing.
* Flags a syntax error but carries on like nothing happened (and builds the AST correctly).
