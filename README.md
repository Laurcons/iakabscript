# IakabScript
An esoteric programming language created to shed light and humour the way a faculty colleague speaks.

This repository contains the official language specification, and the official interpreter ISSI (IakabScript Standard Interpreter).

* Find the specification at [SPEC.md](SPEC.md)
* Learn about ISSI at [issi](issi)

An online IakabScript playground will soon be up.

## FAQ
(but not really coz no one asked)

### Why?
I like making jokes. As it happens, this is my most elaborate joke yet.

### Did you really write an interpreter for this?
Yes. This joke comes with a language interpreter written in C by me, a JS developer.

### Who the hell is Iakab?
Contrary to what you might think, Iakab is not a cult, not a religion. It's just a guy at my faculty who talks funny. How funny? Go write some IS code to see.

### What now?
I am looking to improve this language in the long-run (if I don't get eventually bored). If you know Iakab personally and want to help me with the evolution of this language, please message me (or open an Issue). I'm eager to hear your suggestion!
