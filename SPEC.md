# IakabScript

This is the official language specification for IakabScript (IS).

## Version
This spec is still a draft, and a work in progress. This spec will get version number v1.0 once the official interpreter is out. Until then, feel free to contribute with any suggestions or code examples, by contacting me.

## Profanity warning
Please note that, while the language itself doesn't use profanity in its syntax, profanity is highly recommended when working with IS. The code examples here make extensive use of profanity.

## Sentence structure

All statements in IS are sentences. Ed never touches the Shift key, and instead either talks in all lowercase, or in all uppercase if shouting. Therefore, all sentences in IS are case-insensitive. This being said, it's your responsibility to make the source code's casing interesting.

A sentence is always followed by a DOT `.` or a NL `<NEWLINE>`.

```
Nu deci ilie ii gggggggg
Hoho dutedracu cu ilie oho. Hoho zic "duten pula" hoh
```

### Line splitting
You can split a sentence onto multiple lines by adding `stai` at the end of the lines.
```
nu deci stai
ilie ii ggggggggggggg
```

All the text after `stai`, until the end of the line, will be ignored, so it is recommended that you harrass the reader of your code using your `stai` statements. There is a chance that your interpreter will get offended as well.
```
nu deci stai otara in pula mea ce te grabesti asa
capuluilie ii stai sa imi amintesc
gol <33333333333333
```

Please note that `stai` statements, although similar to comments, are functionally distinct.

## Comments
You can write a comment at any end of a line by appending `<3`. The rest of the line will be ignored.

```
Nu deci ilie ii nbbnbn <3 dal drecu
<3 ce pula mea se intampla aici
```
Under the hood, a comment is treated as a DOT/NL.

Please note that comments, although similar to `stai` statements, are functionally distinct.

## Number literals
Ed doesn't type numbers in chat, and when he does, he surely hates doing it, so IS uses `gg`, `ez` and `nb` to represent number literals.

To represent a number using `gg`, type a bunch of `g`'s. The value of the number literal is the number of `g`'s. For example, `gggggg` would represent the number 6.

As a shorthand, you can write `ez` to represent powers of 10. The amount of `z`'s represent the power. For example, `ezz` would represent 100 and `ezzzzzz` would represent 1000000.

You can additionally represent numbers in binary format. Write the number as you would using 1's and 0's, but instead use `n` and `b`, respectively. For example, `nbbb` is the number 8. (1000b)

The only way to represent a real number is using `eez` notation. This represents a negative power of 10, ie. `eezzzz` is 10^-4, or 0.0001.

The types of real and integer numbers are not differentiated in IS. They fall under the same "number" type.

Compose more complex numbers by using operators such as `ori` or `plus`.

## String literals
Although it might come as a surprise, Ed does actually use double quotes in messages. Therefore, IS supports it.

Write a string literal by encasing it in double quotes (`"`). For example: `"hohohoooo"`. Escaping characters is not possible: you cannot have the character `"` in your string. It's too complicated and Ed wouldn't do that anyway.

## Undefined literal
In cases when a variable doesn't have a value, the state is represented with the `nui` keyword.

```
nu deci pula ii nui
```

## Arrays

Arrays in IS are associative arrays. They work similarly to PHP arrays: they consist of key-value pairs, where the key must be a number or string, and the value can be a string, number, array, or `nui`.

An array literal has the form:
```
multe [key] ii [value] cu [key] ii [value] si atat
```
You can have as many keys and values as you want. Please note that, while [line splitting](#line-splitting) is permitted, you should think: would Ed split his lines? That's what I thought.

An empty array literal has the form:
```
gol
<3 alternative:
golcacapuluilie
```

Arrays have special methods that are used to mutate them. Calling these methods uses a modified [function call](#function-calls) syntax:
```
hoho pe [array] [method] [params] hoh
hohoh pe [array] [method]
```
Available methods:
* `baga [key] [elem]`: Inserts `elem` under the key `key`. If the key exists, the elem will be overwritten.
* `dela [key]`: Returns the element with the key `key`.
* `afar [key]`: Removes the element with the key `key`. Also returns it.
* `catdelung`: Returns the length of the array.

## Booleans
There are no booleans in IS. When evaluating a value as a condition, only a number value of zero is considered false. Everything else (including all strings) are true.

## Identifiers
Identifiers are sequences of characters that identify things in your program, such as function names or variables. You can use any character from A to Z in your identifiers. Please note that identifiers are case-insensitive, as Ed wouldn't care about that. Additionally, you can form an identifier by chaining a bunch of "Smiling face with 3 hearts" emojis. You cannot combine these two methods.

**NOTE:** The interpreter you use determines whether it accepts Unicode source code or not. If not, the emoji notation is not possible.

You cannot have an identifier that starts with `e`, `g`, `n` or `b`, nor any reserved keyword.

Valid identifiers:
* `hohooo`
* `ðŸ¥°ðŸ¥°ðŸ¥°ðŸ¥°ðŸ¥°`
* `ilie`

Invalid identifiers:
* `cacatðŸ¥°ðŸ¥°ðŸ¥°`
* `nu`
* `busimiaicoiele`
* `stai` or `deci` or `hoho` etc.

## Variable declarations
Before you can use any variable, you must declare it inside its scope, and before it is used. I'm sure Ed doesn't like declaring his variables in advance, but sometimes he has to make compromises.

Variables in IS don't have types: they are dynamic, and can hold any type.

Declare a variable using `nu deci [identifier] ii [value]`.

```
nu deci ilie ii gggggggggggg
nu deci bubu ii nbnbnbbbnbnnnnbb
```

You can write multiple declarations on a line by separating them with `si`. This is VERY recommended, as lines can get long, and is exactly what Ed would do.

```
nu deci ilie ii gggggggg si bubu ii nbnb. nu deci iacobu ii nbbbbbb
```

## Functions
Functions can only be declared in the global scope, using the `nu hoho deci` keyword. They follow this general structure:
```
nu hoho deci [function_name] ia [parameters] si fa
<3 function code here
gata
```

`function_name` needs to be a valid identifier. `parameters` is a list of formal parameter names. If the function takes no parameters, use `nimic` instead.

```
<3 valid syntax
nu hoho deci cplm ia nimic si fa
    <3 your function code
gata

<3 or
nu hoho deci uatafac ia pula pizda dracu si fa
    <33333333
gata
```

To return, optionally with a value, use the keyword `iesi`.
```
nu hoho deci pa ia nimic si fa
    iesi nbb
gata
```

A NL or DOT after `fa` is required.

## Function calls
Call a function using the following syntax:
* With parameters: `hoho [functionName] [params] hoh`
* Without parameters: `hohoh [functionName]`

Separate parameters with spaces.

```
hoho uatafac pula pizda oho

hohoh cplm
```

Function calls are expressions, and can be assigned to variables and such.

## Control structures
Control structures follow usual Romanian pseudocode-like expressions.
```
<3 if structure
daca [expression] atunci fa
    <3333
altfel
    <33333
gata
```
```
<3 while structure
cat timp [expression] fa
    <3333
gata
```

A DOT or NL must always follow the `fa` keyword.

There are no other control structures in IS. Ed doesn't need any more.

## Console input/output
To write to the console, use the built-in function `zic`, followed by the variables you want to print.

To read from the console, use the built-in function `zi`. It will read a string from the keyboard and return it.

```
nu deci pula ii gg si pizda ii nbnb
hoho zic "dute dracu" pula pizda oho
```
```
nu deci coie ii hohoh zi
hoho zic coie hoh
```

## Operators
The following table lists all IS operators, in order of precedence (topmost have least priority). Equal priority operators are evaluated LTR. An `X` marks where the operands would be placed.

Keyword | Category | Name | Priority | Observations
--------|----------|------|----------|-------------
X `egal` X | equality | equal | 1
X `inegal` X | equality | not equal | 1
`invers` X | boolean | logical negation | 2
X `sau` X | boolean | logical OR | 2
X `deodatacu` X | boolean | logical AND | 2 | `si` is already a reserved keyword
X `maimare` X | comparison | more than | 3
X `maimic` X | comparison | less than | 3
X `plus` X | arithmetic | addition | 4
X `minus` X | arithmetic | subtraction | 4
`minus` X | arithmetic | negation | 4
X `ori` X | arithmetic | multiplication | 4
X `impartit la` X | arithmetic | division | 4
X `modulo` X | arithmetic | modulo | 4

There are no parantheses in IS. If they were, Ed wouldn't use them. To simulate overriding priority, just use a sequence of variable assignments.

* Comparison and equality operators work with strings by comparing lexicographically.
* The PLUS operator works with strings by returning a concatenated string.

TODO: extend functionality with arrays?

## Assignment
Assign an expression to a variable using the `ii` keyword.
```
nu deci pula ii nui
pula ii nb
pula ii "pa"
pula ii hoho functie pula hoh
hoho zic pula hoh
```

## Including other files
You can include other files in your project with the `avem` keyword, followed by a string. You can only `avem` files in the global scope (not in functions).

The strings need to be names of `.is` files in the current directory, without extensions. Additionally, the interpreter will look for `.is` files in the `coie` directory.

The strings need NOT be surrounded by double quotes. The whole rest of the sentence will be considered as a file name. Spaces will be substituted with underscores.

The strings can only have letters and spaces.

Do not use the word "piton" in any inclusion. It is a reserved keyword.

All included files must have their names in uppercase (on case-sensitive systems like Linux). When including, they can be in any case.

```
avem o pula <3 will look for "O_PULA.is"
avem dute ba in pizda <3 will look for "DUTE_BA_IN_PIZDA.is"
```

## Standard library
IS provides some utility functions. Additionally, any interpreter might provide its own Standard Library utility functions.

### `fanumar`
Takes a string argument and tries to parse a number from it.

This will recognize numbers in the following formats:
* Human format: `1234`, `1234.5`
* `ez` format
* `nb` and `gg` format
* `eez` format

If you want the parser to reject Human formatted numbers, pass `"doariakab"` as a second argument.

The parsed number is returned.

On parsing failure, `nui` is returned.

```
hoho zic hoho fanumar "1234" oho oho <3 prints "1234"
hoho zic hoho fanumar "1234" "doariakab" oho oho <3 prints <nui>
hoho zic hoho fanumar "gg" "doariakab" oho oho <3 prints 2
```

### `fatext`
This will take as argument a number and return its string representation.

Pass a second parameter to specify the way the number will be converted.

This only converts to the Human format, because what Human other than Ed would understand what "gggnb ezzzz" means?

```
hoho zic hoho fatext gggg oho oho <3 prints 4
```

## Code examples

### Is prime?
Task: define a function that returns 1 if its parameter is prime, and 0 otherwise.

```
nu hoho deci prim ia pula si fa
    nu deci i ii g <3 one
    nu deci p ii b <3 zero
    <3 if it's 1 then return 0
    daca pula egal g atunci fa
        iesi b
    gata

    <3 while i <= pula
    cat timp invers i maimare pula fa
        daca pula modulo i egal b atunci fa
            p ii p plus g
        gata

        i ii i plus g
    gata
    iesi p egal gg <3 if equal to 2, it's prime
gata

nu deci v ii nui
v ii hoho prim gg hoh
hoho zic v hoh <3 2 is prime
v ii hoho prim ggg hoh
hoho zic v hoh <3 3 is prime
v ii hoho prim gggg hoh
hoho zic v hoh <3 4 is NOT prime
```

### Counting
Task: write a program that creates an array with numbers from 100 to 1, then prints each one, in reverse order (from 1 to 100).

```
nu deci sir ii gol

<3 generate the array
nu deci i ii ezz si poz ii b
cat timp i maimare b fa

    hoho pe sir baga poz i hoh <3 push i on position poz

    b ii b plus g
    i ii i minus g
gata

<3 print the array
poz ii hohoh pe sir catdelung minus g <3 last position (count - 1)
cat timp invers poz maimic b fa <3 poz >= 0

    nu deci ilie ii hoho pe sir dela poz hoh
    hoho zi ilie hoh

gata

```
